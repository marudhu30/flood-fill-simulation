## ðŸ§  About the Project

This project is a **Flood Fill algorithm simulation** built using the **C programming language**. It visually demonstrates how a recursive flood fill works â€” much like the paint bucket tool in digital drawing apps.

The algorithm starts at a specific point in a matrix and "fills" all connected cells with a new value, replacing the original.

> ðŸ’¡ *This project was developed as part of a college assignment with guidance from AI tools as part of my learning journey.*  
> A great way to explore  **matrix traversal**, and **basic data structures** in C.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To simulate the **Flood Fill algorithm** by filling an enclosed region in a 2D grid, starting from a user-specified coordinate.  
The program uses **recursion** to traverse and fill adjacent cells with a replacement character.

## ðŸ”§ How to Run the Program

Make sure you have GCC installed on your system (Linux/macOS/Windows with MinGW):

```bash
gcc flood_fill_simulation.c -o flood_fill
./flood_fill

```
